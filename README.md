## What is a Database?
- An entity that shares, manages and uses data.
- Without database, a system faces inefficiencies arising from:
  - Data duplication.
  - Difficulty in updating information.
  - Conflicting data within a system.
  - Increase in error-prone activities by human's interaction.

## Challenges a new system has to face
- It must share a standard query structure - easy to use.
- It must have security and permissions to prevent unauthorized data manipulation.
- It must have a mechanism to prevent data conflicts from simulatenous update.
- It must have recovery mechanism from external failures (Internal Server Errors).
